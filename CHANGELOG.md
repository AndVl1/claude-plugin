## 1.11.0 — Deterministic workflows

Make `/team` execution deterministic by turning the workflow from prose into data.

### Added
- **Declarative workflow profiles** (`workflows/*.json`, P1) — 8 profiles (full-feature,
  standard, lightweight, bug-fix, debug-cycle, research, review, emergency) with a stage
  taxonomy (`orchestrator | single | consilium | bash | none`, harnest-style). `_schema.json`
  documents the format; `workflows/README.md` has the resolution table and interpreter contract.
- **Typed handoff artifacts** (`workflows/artifacts-schema.json`, P2) — stages exchange data
  via `.work-state/artifacts/<id>.json` instead of pasted prose; survives compaction, makes
  the inter-stage contract explicit.
- **Machine state** `.work-state/team-state.json` (P4) — classification, stage cursor, and
  monotonic stage status. `team-state.md` remains the human-readable mirror.
- **Per-project config** `.claude/team.config.json` (P6) — role→agent, role→model, and file
  glob→scope mapping resolved deterministically. Schema + example in `workflows/`.
- **State validation hook** `hooks/validate-state.sh` (P4/P5) — PreToolUse(Task) gate that
  blocks agent launches when the classification is missing, the workflow does not match
  `type×complexity`, or stage progress is non-monotonic. Degrades gracefully without `jq`;
  honors `"workflow_override": true`.
- Hook + profile test coverage in `tests/test-hooks.sh` (now 62 assertions); CI watches
  `workflows/**` and `hooks/validate-state.sh`.

### Changed
- `commands/team.md` — added the authoritative **WORKFLOW INTERPRETER** section (classify &
  gate → resolve config → walk stages). The 7-phase prose is retained as **STAGE REFERENCE**
  (prompt templates / criteria per stage type). Backward-compatible; the `/team` return
  contract consumed by `/team-next` is unchanged.

### Notes
- Scope auto-detection has built-in defaults; a dedicated `/team-scope` command to generate a
  project-specific `scope_map` is planned (P3).
